IMPROVEMENTS:

I vastly simplified the code from the previous version by removing shared memory which was used to count simultaneous counts before.
I added a simultaneous count variable to oss.c to count how many processes were running concurrently.
I readded a waitpid(....WNOHANG) to check for terminated processes.
I added a simultaneous count conditional variable to the fork launch section of the code to correctly launch children when the number of
simultaneous processes is below the limit.
I added a process count conditional variable to the fork launch section of the code to correctly prevent launches of children if the 
limit has been reached.

tldr: Deleted like 2/3rd of the code and added correct check


COMPILATION STEPS:

To compile and run the project, ensure that directory has all required files:
1. oss.c (Parent file)
2. user.c (Child Executable file)
3. header.h (Header file)
4. Makefile (Makefile to make project)

To make the project, run the command "make" in command line.
The project takes the following system inputs:
-h Help command
-n Sets total children to run
-s Sets how many concurrent processes can run at a time
-t Sets how many iterations each child executable program runs

If inputs are not used, defaults of 1 are used for each value.

Example command:

$ ./oss -n 5 -s 3 -t 2

This will run 5 child processes with a maximum of 3 concurrent processes with 2 iterations running per child process.

Use the command "make clean" to remove .o files and executables.
